                    My name is Victor Skillerstrand and I am an 18 year old programmer from Sweden. Programming has been a hobby of mine for over a year now and I can honestly say it has genuinly changed my view on games, websites and programs in generall. Each and every time I start a game or visit a page, I immediately want to know how that was created; what language it has been written in, how many individual programmers and/or designers worked to achieve it and so on. By doing this my interest in creating a indie-game or a website sparked. Even this website was made in HTML & CSS by me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this website is to show what I have done and what I am capable of doing. On the "Projects" page you can see some of my earlier creations (mostly games). The "Programming" page contains my knowledge of certain languages and what I am currently learning, as well as my progress in those particular languages.
                </p>

                    If you or your team are interested in working with me in any way feel free to contact me on the bottom right side of this page. I generally respond quite fast but it might vary from day to day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hope to hear from you and/or your team soon, cheers! <br/><br/>- Victor Skillerstrand
